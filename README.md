Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you. In this project, I will take you through how to train a car price prediction model with machine learning using Python.

So this is how you can train a machine learning model for the task of predicting car prices by using the Python programming language. It is a major research topic in machine learning because the price of a car depends on many factors.
